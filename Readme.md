# SOLID Principles, Dependency Injection, OOPs Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating SOLID principles and Dependency Injection, OOPs Sample Code implemented in both Java and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. emphasizing the decoupling of high-level modules from low-level modules by introducing an abstraction layer between them.

This repository contains sample code illustrating each of the SOLID principles and Dependency Injection, OOPs in both Java and JavaScript/TypeScript.

### SOLID Principles: Guidelines for Better Software Systems

1. **Maintainability**:

   - Ensure Bug-Free Code
   - Enhance Readability and Understandability
   - Facilitate Easy Debugging and Maintenance

2. **Extendability**:

   - Enable Addition of New Features with Minimal Impact
   - Promote Scalability and Adaptability to Future Requirements
   - Support Seamless Integration of Enhancements

3. **Reusability**:

   - Encourage Componentization and Modularization
   - Foster Creation of Highly Cohesive and Loosely Coupled Modules

4. **Easily Testable**:
   - Test Coverage should be their
5. **Modular**
   - Easy to read the code
   - Easy to debug code

- ##### Single Responsibility Principle [SRP](SOLID/SRP/SRP.md)
- ##### Open/Closed Principle [OCP](SOLID/OCP/ocp.md)
- ##### Liskov Substitution Principle [LSP](SOLID/LSP/lsp.md)
- ##### Interface Segregation Principle [ISP](SOLID/ISP/isp.md)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the sample code up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/stormdotcom/Low-Level-Design-LLD-
   ```

2. Navigate to the `java` or `root` ( for js/ts) directory, depending on the language you want to explore.

3. Choose a specific SOLID principle or Dependency Inversion example folder.

4. Explore the code.

## Java Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Demonstrates how to design classes that have a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Shows how to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Illustrates how to use subclassing without introducing bugs.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Demonstrates how to segregate interfaces to make them more focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Shows how to design modules that depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## JavaScript/TypeScript Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** JavaScript/TypeScript examples demonstrating classes with single responsibilities.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** JavaScript/TypeScript examples showing how to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** JavaScript/TypeScript examples illustrating substitution of derived classes for base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** JavaScript/TypeScript examples demonstrating how to split interfaces to keep them focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** JavaScript/TypeScript examples showing how to invert dependencies to decouple components.
