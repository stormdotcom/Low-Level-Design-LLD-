## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles, emphasizing the decoupling of high-level modules from low-level modules by introducing an abstraction layer between them.

This repository contains sample code illustrating each of the SOLID principles and Dependency Inversion in both Java and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the sample code up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solid-and-dip-sample-code.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `java` or `js` directory, depending on the language you want to explore.

3. Choose a specific SOLID principle or Dependency Inversion example folder.

4. Follow the instructions in the respective README file for each example to understand the concept and explore the code.

## Java Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Demonstrates how to design classes that have a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Shows how to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Illustrates how to use subclassing without introducing bugs.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Demonstrates how to segregate interfaces to make them more focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Shows how to design modules that depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## JavaScript Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** JavaScript examples demonstrating classes with single responsibilities.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** JavaScript examples showing how to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** JavaScript examples illustrating substitution of derived classes for base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** JavaScript examples demonstrating how to split interfaces to keep them focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** JavaScript examples showing how to invert dependencies to decouple components.
