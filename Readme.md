# SOLID Principles, Dependency Injection, OOPs Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating SOLID principles and Dependency Injection, OOPs Sample Code implemented in both Java and JavaScript.


## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. emphasizing the decoupling of high-level modules from low-level modules by introducing an abstraction layer between them.

This repository contains sample code illustrating each of the SOLID principles and Dependency Injection, OOPs in both Java and JavaScript.

### SOLID Principles: Guidelines for Better Software Systems

1. **Maintainability**:
   - Ensure Bug-Free Code
   - Enhance Readability and Understandability
   - Facilitate Easy Debugging and Maintenance

2. **Extendability**:
   - Enable Addition of New Features with Minimal Impact
   - Promote Scalability and Adaptability to Future Requirements
   - Support Seamless Integration of Enhancements

3. **Reusability**:
   - Encourage Componentization and Modularization
   - Foster Creation of Highly Cohesive and Loosely Coupled Modules

4. **Easily Testable**:
    - Test Coverage should be their
    
5.  **Modular**
    - Easy to read the code
    - Easy to debug code

 - #### Single Responsibility Principle [SRP](SRP/srp.md)
 - #### Open/Closed Principle [OCP](OCP/ocp.md)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the sample code up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/stormdotcom/Low-Level-Design-LLD-
   ```

2. Navigate to the `java` or `js` directory, depending on the language you want to explore.

3. Choose a specific SOLID principle or Dependency Inversion example folder.

4. Follow the instructions in the respective README file for each example to understand the concept and explore the code.

## Java Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Demonstrates how to design classes that have a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Shows how to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Illustrates how to use subclassing without introducing bugs.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Demonstrates how to segregate interfaces to make them more focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Shows how to design modules that depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## JavaScript Samples

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** JavaScript examples demonstrating classes with single responsibilities.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** JavaScript examples showing how to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** JavaScript examples illustrating substitution of derived classes for base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** JavaScript examples demonstrating how to split interfaces to keep them focused.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** JavaScript examples showing how to invert dependencies to decouple components.
